# Hyein, Jeong
I am interested in how people comprehend and produce multi-word utterances, integrating different kinds of semantic information. Previously, I investigated the mechanism of sentence comprehension in Korean with a focus on semantic processing (e.g. homonymy, polysemy, metaphor) using ERPs and reaction time measures. In my phd project, I investiage the role of phrase frequency during phrase production.
